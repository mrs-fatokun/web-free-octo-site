### What I learned
i was able to learn that float in cSS can be used to put text side by side when they have different divs in HTML.i also learn how to use css to cross a text with a line using text-decoration-line.The project made me learn that a boarder radius can be used to style a div.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
 <div id="text-1">
                <h2>$149.99  </h2>
              </div>
              <div id="text-2">
                                         
              <p> $169.99</p>
            </div>
        
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css 
#text-1{
        color: green;
        float: left;
        width: 30%;
        position: absolute;
        bottom: 70px;
        
    }
    #text-2{
        color: rgba(15, 15, 239, 0.393);
        float: right;
        width: 30%;
        position: absolute;
        right: 80px;
        bottom: 80px;
        text-decoration-line: line-through;
         }
    
```html
<div id="text-2">
                                         
              <p> $169.99</p>
            </div>


```css
#text-2{
  text-decoration-line: line-through;
}



### Continued development
i am interested in a future project that i will be making use of magins and padding in div because sometimes i do get confused on the one to use.
